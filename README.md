## General info
Functions to reduce some of the busywork common to standard C. Some files can be
thought of as extensions of libc files: stdio2.h, string2.h. Other files do not
correspond to anything in the standard library. For API details, please consult
the [header files](https://github.com/adrianclinansmith/C_CustomLibraries/tree/master/include).

## Technologies
Conforms to the C11 standard.

## Setup
For use in your own project, add one or more [header files](https://github.com/adrianclinansmith/C_CustomLibraries/tree/master/include) to your own C header
files, and add the corresponding [implementation files](https://github.com/adrianclinansmith/C_CustomLibraries/tree/master/src) to your C implementation
files, then compile your project as usual.
