## General info
This library can reduce some of the busywork common to vanilla C. Some files
directly extend libc. For example, the functions in this library's string2.h
would not seem out of place in libc's string.h. File's that extend libcnshare a
name with their associate libc header file: stdio2.h, string2.h, etc. This
library also provides files that do not correspond to anything in libc such as
strarr.h. For API details, please consult the [header files](https://github.com/adrianclinansmith/C_CustomLibraries/tree/master/include).
